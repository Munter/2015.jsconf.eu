description: >-
  Web app technical diagrams fall into the trap of over simplifying complexity.
  And so diagrams which are meant to represent 1,000s or even 10,000s of hours of
  the large scale multidisciplinary construction effort that is a web app project
  is reduced to sticks-and-clouds architecture drawings, coarse wire frames
  and/or detailed UI mockups or screenshots.



  What's missing from these representations ? Usually a lot - like code volume,
  3rd party dependencies, environments, delivery processes and so much more. This
  talk presents a new vision of web app technology diagrams using the structural
  engineering drawing technique of isometric projections to provide much better
  perspective of the multi dimensional nature of web app programming projects.



  A taste of this new style of diagraming of web apps can be seen, today, at the
  speaker's site stackynotes.com but diagrams with much more depth and breadth
  will be explored in the actual conference talk.
