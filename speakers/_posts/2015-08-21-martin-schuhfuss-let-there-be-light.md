  It is long known that the quality and setting of the light in our environment
  influences our moods and minds in a near-infinite number of ways. Yet the
  lights in most homes and work places are still restricted to the ever present
  on-/and off-switches (and maybe some dimming).



  Enough of that. Take some of the modern lighting-solutions today, add a healthy
  dose of JavaScript and sprinkle with some other web technologies to create and
  control your own lights to suit any of your moods and ideas – directly from
  within your browser. In a very colorful talk full of practical examples I will
  demonstrate a number of those possibilities.



  Can we use these tricks to even control professional light-equipment on stage?
  You'll see.
