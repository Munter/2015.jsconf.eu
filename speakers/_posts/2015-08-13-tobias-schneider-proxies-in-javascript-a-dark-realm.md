description: "Let me introduce you to the world of meta programming in JavaScript using ES6 Proxies and ES7 Realms. In this talk you will learn how to use proxies for the (more) useful things they are designed for and some hacks that will definitely extend your horizon for whats possible with these new EcmaScript features. Reaching from bringing back __noSuchMethod__ over sandboxing untrusted scripts to implementing different JavaScript dialects that don't need yet another transpiler, I'm pretty sure there is something mind-blowing for everyone."
