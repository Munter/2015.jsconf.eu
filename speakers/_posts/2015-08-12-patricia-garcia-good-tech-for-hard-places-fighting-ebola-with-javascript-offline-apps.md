description: >-
  On 23rd July 2014, the first case of Ebola was reported in Nigeria, home to
  a small NGO working at the intersection of tech and public health. By then over
  1000 cases had been reported in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. This is
  a story of how we use JavaScript to fight the Ebola outbreak. It’s also a story
  of building good tech for hard places, where a stable internet connection is
  rare and emergencies are real.



  There are a lot of awesome technologies (e.g. CouchDB and PouchDB) out there to
  help you build offline applications. There is also no shortage of beginner
  level online tutorials to show you how to do a quick and nice first prototype,
  but as in any new field there is not so much documentation available to help
  you solve the problems you'll find when deploying your offline applications to
  be used in the “real” world. This talk will present some of these problems as
  well as the solutions we came up with, including some open source tools
  developed by ourselves.
