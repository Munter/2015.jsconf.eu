  There was a time when data connections like WiFi and Bluetooth didn't exist,
  yet people still managed to send information over long distances using clever
  encodings like Morse Code, sound waves and visual impulses.



  What can we learn from that?



  This talk looks at ways to use web platform capabilities, like the Web Audio
  API, Ambient Light Events and Touch Events, to revisit old data transmission
  techniques and apply them in new contexts. We'll use demos to explore
  ultrasonic networking between air-gapped devices, indoor positioning without
  GPS and sending data through touch.



  Finally, we'll look at the privacy implications these unconventional networking
  capabilities bring.
