  Are you interested in learning about functional programming? Are you reaching
  the limits of abstraction when programming in JavaScript? Do you sometimes find
  yourself lost in a forest of callbacks?

  In this talk we explore functional programming concepts, which help us create
  powerful abstractions to master complex problems and create more simple and
  elegant programs.



  JavaScript allows us to ease into the functional programming style, letting us
  focus just on the concepts, without the distraction of learning a specific
  functional programming language.



  To make the dry functional programming concepts more digestible, we use cooking
  as an analogy.

  And since the logician Haskell Curry invented functional programming, we
  combine our journey in JavaScript with examples and recipes for tasty curry
  dishes.

  So even if you get stuck on concepts like higher order functions, continuation
  passing style or monads, you will at least not go home hungry.
