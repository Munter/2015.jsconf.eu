description: "Near space is a region of the Earth's atmosphere starting at 20 km, high enough to boil water at body temperature.  With a little bit of preparation, you can launch a ballon carrying a payload of sensors and cameras driven by JavaScript into near space at twice the height that commercial airlines can fly.  I will guide you through the hardware, software and red tape you should be familiar with to create your own high altitude experiments. Let's take back cloud computing!"
