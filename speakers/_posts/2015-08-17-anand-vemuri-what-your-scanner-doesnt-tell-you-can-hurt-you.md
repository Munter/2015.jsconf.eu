  Modern JavaScript libraries and frameworks have become the de facto standard in
  web application development. However, the great strides in innovation have
  created framework-specific security vulnerabilities that most modern JavaScript
  security scanners are not programmed to search for.  Personal research with
  intentionally vulnerable applications as well as live production code has shown
  that many popular scanners do not detect common application vulnerabilities.



  This talk will discuss some common security pitfalls developers make when
  working with popular client-side JavaScript frameworks. Intentionally
  vulnerable applications developed with Backbone.js, Angular.js, Ember.js, and
  Meteor,js will be attacked and exploited live. Github links to the vulnerable
  applications used in this presentation will be released after the presentation.
  Through strengthening the security posture of JavaScript applications, we can
  take strides towards creating a more secure Internet.
