description: "In an industry that is so focused frameworks & tooling, we tend to lose sight  of the people behind the products and how we work with them. I've found empathy to be a powerful resource while collaborating with teams inside companies and across the open source community. By breaking down The Other Side of Empathy, I will demonstrate how applying its principles to your development process will benefit the community and the products they create. "
