description: "A lot of us are engineers at companies that don't enshrine technology as their core product, or that employ significantly more non-technical than technical people. Others of us work completely alone as freelancers. If you're in that position, how do you create a place for technological transformation in the organization, or communicate with non-technical clients?\n\nI'll cover how to \n- evaluate what your project needs\n- maintain your productivity\n- create understanding of technical issues\n- keep learning without anyone around to teach you new stuff.\n"
