description: "What is common for Walt Disney World, airports and magicians? All of these are distorting user's perception to build illusions that make us feel good even though we don't notice them so easily. Those are time illusions. Developers, as magicians, can use the same techniques to distort users' perception of time to deliver fast and competitive products. The talk is about psychology, perception, time and, of course, illusions."
