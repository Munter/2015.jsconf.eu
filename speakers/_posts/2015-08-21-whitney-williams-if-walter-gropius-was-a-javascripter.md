description: 'The Bauhaus school’s emphasis on the importance of simplicity, the belief that form follows function, and the reconciliation of the fine and applied arts mirrors the development community’s struggles to reconcile code with design. We’ll examine how the ideas of Walter Gropius and other leading minds at the Bauhaus remain relevant nearly a century later, and focus on how these fundamental tenets can guide the way we structure our JavaScript.'
