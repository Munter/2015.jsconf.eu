  Remember the old joke about how the Java slogan "write once, run everywhere"
  was more like "write once, debug everywhere"? Good one. Actually, many people
  say this about the Web, too. In fact, it would be more accurate in our case to
  state it as "write once, debug everywhere, each time with different tools". But
  does it have to be that way?



  A new Firefox feature called Valence allows you to debug your web app in any
  target environment: Firefox, Chrome, iOS, Android, you name it. Does it
  actually work? How does it work? Can we expect more from it? How can other
  browsers use it? In this talk we will find the answers to these questions and
  discuss the accuracy of the tentative slogan "write once, debug everywhere,
  from Firefox" (or lack thereof).
