  Time zones – the undoing of many developers’ sense of sanity. Get them right
  and most likely your users won’t even notice. Get them wrong and you can end up
  increasing racial tensions in the Middle East.

  As we embed ourselves further into this Brave New World of JS Everywhere, let
  us not forget the basic lessons from before JS existed. This talk will explain
  the oddities, pitfalls, and ever-changing nature of time zones, so that you may
  learn from my mistakes (I wasn’t kidding about the Middle East bit).
