  Hi, I’m from the future. The year 2035 to be precise. The browser wars are
  over. The web has almost been destroyed. A new wave of native apps for Android
  Yoghurt, and the removal of Safari from iOS 29 has brought web browsing to its
  knees. Recently all major browser vendors united to channel their strengths
  toward a single browser - Chromiefox.



  I’ve been sent back to warn you, to try change things by showing you the
  potential of the web. I’ll show you how the web looks in the future, but using
  today’s technologies. We’ll investigate how to create the Sci-Fi interfaces
  you’ve seen in movies, as well as discuss why the web should win.
