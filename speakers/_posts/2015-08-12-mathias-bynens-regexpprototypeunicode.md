  User input and string manipulation are central to development, but many
  engineers and even popular libraries struggle with Unicode. And ECMAScript
  5 doesn’t help, with many built-in string manipulation functions offering
  puzzling results. Security and the need for internationalization both throw
  these issues into stark relief. This talk highlights the many problems related
  to Unicode in JavaScript regular expressions, demonstrates how ES6 (aka.
  ECMAScript 2015) helps solve these issues, and explains how to polyfill in the
  mean time.



  You’ll walk away from this presentation knowing how to create Unicode-aware
  regular expressions in JavaScript with ease.
