  We probably all know that diverse teams are effective teams. Teams with more
  gender diversity have been proven to be more creative, productive, innovative.
  Nevertheless, the technology industry, has been showing a recent and steady
  decline regarding women who find and pursue degrees in what should be a growing
  pool of opportunity. In this talk we’ll examine the reasons behind the
  gender­gap in IT by going on a small trip and we'll figure out what we can do
  to make our community better in only a couple days!
