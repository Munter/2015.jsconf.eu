  In the recent time Web development community had a big discussion on "DOM is
  slow" topic. This thesis is truthful. DOM is a quite complex model which starts
  a ripple of events or chain reaction over document on every modification.

  HTML GL solves "the slow DOM problem" by creating WebGL representations of DOM
  elements and hiding actual DOM after. This speeds up HTML/CSS animations and
  transformations by using 3D hardware acceleration and allows to apply OpenGL
  effects as modern 3D games have.



  In this talk:



  - The "Slow DOM problem";

  - Solutions possible

  - DOM optimization vs alternative rendering approaches(React-canvas, Netflix
  methodology);

  - Seeking for an ideal solution;

  - Rendering content via WebGL using HTML GL

  - Limitations, recommendations

  - Where to go further?
