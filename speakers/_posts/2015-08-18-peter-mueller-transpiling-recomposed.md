description: >-
  Modern web developers have become heavily dependent on abstractions like jade,
  sass or ES6. These are powerful tools, but to themselves require new
  abstractions, wrappers and runners. The rate at which new tools, workflows and
  even languages are appearing is staggering. Each iteration adds more complexity
  and less interoperability.



  So how do we expect newcomers to be able to enter our field when we can hardly
  keep up ourself?



  This will be an exploration of our tool chains with a focus on transpilers. The
  mission: To identify moving parts, recompose and simplify for the good of the
  current and future generation of  developers.
