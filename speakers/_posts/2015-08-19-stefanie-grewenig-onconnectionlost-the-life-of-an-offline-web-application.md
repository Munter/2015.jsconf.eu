description: >-
  Can you use HTML5 technologies to build a web application which works offline?
  Without a reliable internet connection? Let’s say for two weeks?



  That is what our client asked us to build. Their people will use the
  application on the road; reading documents, entering results and uploading
  pictures. And then they come home, connect to the internet and sync their
  results with their colleagues’.
